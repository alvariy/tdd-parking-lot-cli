Codes that has been refactored:
changeVariable names
parkingLot2 = secondParkingLot <= variable
Remove given when then comments in test cases
For more readable code I changed the variable in assert line to actual and expected values
Remove System out in line 105
Remove unecessary comments
Remove one parameter in line 15 in ParkingBoy.java
Change string literal to constants in errorMessage
Convert the checking of ratio to a method
Convert duplicate condition then I created a method for that
Change attributes of ParkingBoy from publiv to private

Code Smells: 
Duplicated Code
